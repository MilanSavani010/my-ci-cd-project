# CI-CD

this project shows how the github action runner coming into action to automate the software packaging-to-deployment.
# CI/CD Pipeline with Security Integration

This project demonstrates a modern CI/CD pipeline using a **self-hosted GitHub Actions runner** with Docker integration and security tools at multiple stages. The pipeline automates software packaging, testing, security scanning, and deployment, following DevSecOps best practices.

## Pipeline Overview

- **Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner**: Full Docker support for building, testing, and scanning.
- **Multi-stage workflow**:
  - **Secret scanning**: [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) scans for secrets in code.
  - **Build & Test**: Node.js app is built and tested.
  - **Static Analysis**: [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) scans for code vulnerabilities.
  - **Artifact upload**: Security reports are uploaded for review.
- **Docker-based execution**: Security tools run in official Docker containers.
- **Dependency caching**: Dockerfile and workflow are structured for efficient builds.

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Preparation

- See [docs/CICD_Getting_Started.md](docs/CICD_Getting_Started.md) for step-by-step instructions:
  - Initialize your project and Git repository.
  - Add a `.gitignore` and a basic app file (Node.js or .NET example provided).

### 2. Self-Hosted Runner Setup

- Follow GitHub's instructions to [add a self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners).
- Ensure Docker is installed and accessible by the runner (mount `/var/run/docker.sock` if running in Docker).

### 3. Configure CI/CD Workflow

- The main workflow is in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
- It includes:
  - **Secret scanning** with Gitleaks (see [docs/tools/semgrep.md](docs/tools/semgrep.md) for usage).
  - **Build, test, and static analysis** with Semgrep.
  - **Artifact upload** for security reports.

### 4. Security Tools

- **Gitleaks**: Detects secrets in code and blocks leaks ([usage](docs/tools/semgrep.md)).
- **Semgrep**: Static code analysis for vulnerabilities ([usage](docs/tools/semgrep.md)).
- Additional tools (Trivy, Snyk, etc.) can be integrated as needed.

### 5. DevSecOps Pipeline

- See [docs/DevSec_Getting_Started.md](docs/DevSec_Getting_Started.md) for a visual and detailed breakdown of the security stages, including diagrams and reporting.
